Additional scripts
==================

cnv_annotate.py
    Update gene names (the 'gene' column) in CNVkit .cnn/.cnr files,
    using gene annotations from another UCSC RefFlat, BED, or GFF file (e.g.
    refFlat.txt). This may be useful if you notice at the end of an analysis
    that vendor-annotated targets are not the desired gene names, and want to
    change the labeling without repeating the analysis with an updated target
    BED file.

cnv_updater.py
    Update .cnn, .cnr and .cns files previously generated by earlier versions of
    CNVkit to add a "depth" column used in CNVkit version 0.8.0 and later. The
    script reads each input file, calculates absolute-scale depth from the
    file's existing "log2" column value in each row, and creates a corresponding
    output file with a modified name -- the input files are not modified
    in-place.

    Running this script is not necessary for new analyses, but may help ease
    the transition for analyses that have already begun.

cnv_ztest.py
    Test each bin in a .cnr file individually for non-neutral copy number.
    Specifically, calculate the probability of a bin's log2 value versus a
    normal distribution with a mean of of 0 and standard deviation
    back-calculated from bin weight. Output another .cnr file with z-test
    probabilities in the additional column "ztest"; drop rows where the
    probability is above the threshold (``--alpha``/``-a``).

guess_baits.py
    Use the read depths in one or more given BAM files to infer which regions
    were targeted in a hybrid capture or targeted amplicon capture sequencing
    protocol.
    This script can be used in case the original BED file of targeted intervals
    is unavailable. (However, CNVkit will give much better results if the true
    targeted intervals can be provided.)
    It works in 2 modes, guided and unguided:

    - **Guided:** Given candidate targets, such as all known exons in the reference
      genome, test the mean coverage depth in each candidate target and drop
      those that did not receive sufficient coverage, presumed to be those exons
      or genes that were not targeted by the sequencing library. ::

        guess_baits.py Sample1.bam Sample2.bam -t ucsc-exons.bed -o baits.bed

    - **Unguided:** Scan every base in the sample BAM(s), inferring likely
      boundaries for enriched regions. (This is usually much slower then the
      guided approach.) ::

        guess_baits.py -g access.hg19.bed Sample1.bam Sample2.bam -o baits.bed

reference2targets.py
    Extract target and antitarget BED files from a CNVkit reference file.
    While the :ref:`batch` command does this step automatically when an existing
    reference is provided, you may find this standalone script useful to recover
    the target and antitarget BED files that match the reference if those BED
    files are missing or you're not sure which ones are correct.

    Alternatively, once you have a stable CNVkit reference for your platform,
    you can use this script to drop the "bad" bins from your target and
    antitarget BED files (and subsequently built references) to avoid
    unnecessarily calculating coverage in those bins during future runs.

refFlat2bed.py
    (Deprecated in favor of `skg_convert.py`)

    Generate a BED file of the genes or exons in the reference genome given in
    UCSC refFlat.txt format. (Download the input file from `UCSC Genome
    Bioinformatics <http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html>`_).

skg_convert.py
    Convert between any of the tabular data formats supported by skgenome.tabio,
    including BED and UCSC RefFlat.
