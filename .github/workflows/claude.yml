            This is a bioinformatics Python package for copy number variant detection.

            - Follow the project's code style conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
            - All code must work with Python 3.10+
            - Security tools (bandit) are configured to allow subprocess calls needed for bioinformatics tools
            - R is required for segmentation (DNAcopy package)
            - Pre-commit hooks are configured - run before committing
            - Use pytest for testing, not unittest
            - Respect the existing architecture (see CLAUDE.md for details)
